# Cloud Computing in Data Analysis: Azure and AWS

This section summarizes my key takeaways from the **Azure and AWS** modules of Alex the Analyst's Data Analyst Bootcamp. The focus was on understanding cloud computing concepts, data services, and security best practices for data analytics.

## ðŸ”¹ **Microsoft Azure: Key Learnings**
1. **Azure SQL Database**  
   - Understanding **Platform as a Service (PaaS)** and its benefits for managing relational databases.  
   - Using **Azure SQL Server** to create, manage, and query databases.  
   - Implementing **firewall rules and authentication** for secure access.  

2. **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**  
   - Introduction to **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and data pipeline automation.  
   - Creating **Linked Services** to connect Azure resources.  
   - Understanding **Integration Runtimes** and data flow control.  

3. **Azure Blob Storage**  
   - Storing and retrieving structured/unstructured data efficiently.  
   - Setting up **access tiers (Hot, Cool, Archive)** for cost optimization.  
   - Configuring **role-based access control (RBAC)** for security.  

4. **Azure Synapse Analytics**  
   - Overview of **Big Data processing** in Azure.  
   - Running **SQL queries on distributed data warehouses**.  
   - Understanding **data partitioning and performance optimization**.  

## ðŸ”¹ **Amazon Web Services (AWS): Key Learnings**
1. **AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service)**  
   - Creating and managing **S3 buckets** for scalable storage.  
   - Understanding **object lifecycle policies** for efficient storage cost management.  
   - Configuring **S3 access policies** for security and permissions.  

2. **AWS RDS (Relational Database Service)**  
   - Setting up **cloud-based SQL databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
   - Managing **automated backups and high availability**.  
   - Implementing **IAM policies** for secure access control.  

3. **AWS Glue & Athena**  
   - Using **AWS Glue** for **ETL pipeline automation** and data cataloging.  
   - Running **SQL queries on S3 data** using **Athena** (serverless querying).  

## ðŸ”¹ **Cloud Security & Best Practices**
- Understanding **shared responsibility model** in cloud security.  
- Implementing **IAM roles and policies** for access control.  
- Importance of **data encryption and network security** in cloud environments.
