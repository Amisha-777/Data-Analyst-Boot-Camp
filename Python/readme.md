# Python Module

## Key Learnings: 
- **Python Fundamentals:** Understanding variables, data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans), and operators
- **Control Flow & Logic:** Enhanced ability to implement decision-making processes using conditional statements and loops.
- **File Handling:** Developed competence in reading from and writing to various file types, and managing file systems.
- **Web Scraping:** Inspecting a webpage to extract data and save it in a csv format.
- **Data Analysis with Pandas:** Aunderstanding patterns, trends, and relationships through statistical tools and visualizations using pandas and matplotlib.


## Projects Overview
1. **Data Analysis with Pandas**
Conducted an exploratory data analysis on a sales dataset to uncover insights into sales trends, regional performance, and product popularity.
**Key Learnings:**
     - **Pandas Library:** Mastered the use of Pandas for data manipulation, including loading datasets, handling missing values, and filtering data.
     - **Data Aggregation:** Employed grouping and aggregation methods to summarize data and extract meaningful statistics.
     - **Data Visualization:** Created visual representations of data using Pandas' built-in plotting capabilities to     identify patterns and trends.
   - **Files:**

2. **BMI Calculator**
Developed a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that takes user input for weight and height, computes the BMI, and provides health status based on the calculated value.
**Key Learnings:**
     - Utilized variables and arithmetic operations.
     - Implemented control flow with if-else statements.
     - Enhanced user interaction through input functions.

## Conclusion
Completing these projects has significantly bolstered my Python programming capabilities, particularly in the realms of data analysis and web scraping.
